# Project Four - Caleidoscope - Frontend
### [Backend Repo](https://github.com/xlnl/p4-caleidoscope-backend)
### [Deployed App](https://caleidoscope.herokuapp.com/)
## Frontend Tech Used
* Notion & Github - for project management

* React.js - for JS library
* Chakra-UI - for styling and general UI
* fullCalendar - for calendar plug-in
* APIs - Aztro (horoscope) + OpenWeatherMap (weather)

## General Approach
The name "Caleidoscope" is a marriage of calendar and kaleidoscope, indicating the prisms of life events that we seem to be inundated with as time goes on. 

The purpose of this project was to predict, plan, and organize for a streamlined personal management system.

## User Stories
### MVP
As a user, I want to be able to: 
* see a landing page before I log in/sign up so I can know more about the app.
* sign up, log in, and/or log out of the app
* access a dashboard to see the current weather in my area, horoscope reading based on my astrological sign, full monthly calendar, my notes, and a place to take notes
* create, read, update, and delete a note on my dashboard
### STRETCH
As a user, I want to be able to: 
* create, read, update, and delete an event on my calendar
* seamlessly create notes without having to click save
* hide my horoscope and weather app 
* update my location or astrological sign to see queried data

## Installation Instructions

>
> npm start

## Major Hurdles & Unsolved Problems 
As expected, state management is still a muscle I have to flex and get used to. I'm planning on adding more to this to ensure API calls are properly places and sucessful based on currentUser.
